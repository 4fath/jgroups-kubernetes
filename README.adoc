= Kubernetes discovery protocol for JGroups

`KUBE_PING` is a discovery protocol for JGroups cluster nodes managed by Kubernetes.

Discovery is done by asking Kubernetes for a list of IP addresses of all nodes. Combined with `bind_port` / `port_range`
of the transport, the protocol will then send a discovery request to all instances and wait for the responses. This
is done by the superclass `TCPPING` (see  http://www.jgroups.org/manual4/index.html#TCPPING_Prot for details).
