= Kubernetes discovery protocol for JGroups

This is the development branch for the new version of `KUBE_PING`. We plan a lot of changes and you should probably have a look at the `stable` branch.

== Plans for the future:

[x] Rebase on JGroups 4
[x] Remove DNS PING (use the one shipped by JGroups instead)
[x] Remove HTTP Server
[ ] Introduce JSON parsing library instead of DMR
[x] KUBE_PING should extend (and reuse the logic of) TCPPING
